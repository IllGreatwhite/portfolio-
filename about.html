    		Hi, my name is Jack, I'm currently a student at Udacity learning how to code. I discovered my joy for coding quite by accident, I was working at a hotel when one day I volunteered to help the resident DJ to set up a web page for an upcoming event. I managed to get my head arond how to work wordpress and managed to create a nice webpage. I was curious as to how it all worked and started to investigate. eventually I taught myself HTML through the W3School page and decided that I wanted to learn more, thats when I discovered Udacity, I enrolled in their full stack web developer course and haven't looked back! I'm hoping to go deeper into front end design as I really enjoy creating and developing web pages, hopefully after finishing this course I'll start the front end nanodegree and then get a job.
